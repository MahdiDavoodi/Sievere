# Sievere | Android music player.
![](media/Sievere.png)
#### Hello friend!

*It's me, the developer. I'm so glad that you are reading this now. Currently, I am learning Android development and I am getting better day by day. I will try to implement every new and useful thing that I learn. If I want to make this short, Sievere is an app for you, by you! It means you can say what you want (with creating issues) to see in future updates so I will start working on it.*

*You can see my [TODO list](https://trello.com/b/L6bRU2oF/android-music-player) down below to know what you probably see in the next version!*

## Selected tasks for next version (1.0):
	- Support notification panel for the player.
	- Play music!
	- Support dark mode in Android 9+. 

## TODO Tasks:
	- Support Spotify API and show playlists in a new tab.
	- Support multiple layouts for the Now Playing page.
	- Make themes better.
	- Support changing the themes in-app settings.
	- Support multiple languages.
	- Support controlling the audio from the lock screen.
	- Add auto edit tags option.
	- Give the user the choice to select and deselect some folders for scanning the music library.
	- Create some good widgets for the app.

#### For Developers.

## First of all,
	- The way I implemented things is not efficient, good, or may not even correct and that's because I'm a beginner.
	- I don't know anything about design patterns and structures yet, so this repo is a piece of shit and It may be hard to contribute. I'm sorry for that.
	- Consider helping me to fix my problems instead of shiting on me or my app.

## If you want to help or contribute,
	- Thank you :).
	- Please don't do anything about the TODO list. I want to work on new features by myself to improve my skills.
	- Feel free to create an issue.

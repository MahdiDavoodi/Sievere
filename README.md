    -   Finish Info Activity.
    -   Set up all activities from now.

### TODO Tasks:
    -   Support notification panel for the player.
	-   Support Spotify API and show playlists in a new tab.
	-   Support multiple layouts for the Now Playing page.
	-   Make themes better.
	-   Support changing the themes in-app settings.
	-   Support multiple languages.

### TODO Tasks:
    -   Support notification panel for the player.
	-   Support Spotify API and show playlists in a new tab.
	-   Support multiple layouts for the Now Playing page.
	-   Make themes better.
	-   Support changing the themes in-app settings.
	-   Support multiple languages.
	-   Support controlling the audio from the lock screen.
	-   Add auto edit tags option.
	-   Give the user the choice to select and deselect some folders for scanning the music library.
	-   Create some good widgets for the app.
